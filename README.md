# Reinforcement-Learning
This repo includes tasks from Reinforcement Learning course from Lazy Programmer on Udemy.

### Tic Tac Toe agent
`tic_tac_toe.py` - Create environment of Tic Tac Toe game and learn 2 agents to play versus each other, so now it's impossible to win them

### Markov Decision Process
`gridworld.py` - creating grid for game
`iterative_policy_evaluation.py` - calculating value with given policy
`policy_iteration.py` - iterative policy improvement algorithm (policy evaluation - policy improvement until convergence)
`policy_iteration_random.py` - the same as previous, but with stochastic p(s', r|s, a)
`value_iteration.py` - iterative value improvement algorithm without policy improvement step (more efficient)
